<h2>Learn Romans 2</h2>


<h4>High Concept:</h4>
<p>The game would have players learn Roman Number by having fun and being interactive with the screen and the computer. If players want to get better in the game, they would have to learn the roman numbers better..</p>

<h4>Player Experience Goals:</h4>
<p>This game was created to have players have the expierence that they need to concentrate and learn Roman Numbers. <small>For those who have never seen roman numbers before it goes I, II, III, IV, V, as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. </small></p>


<h4>Genre:</h4>
<p>This is a catch the falling object learning game.</p>


<h4>Game play:</h4>
<p>The player has very limited option in this game. To start the game, the player must click on the screen play with their mouse. Afterwards, the game will drop a Roman number . Then the player has the option of clicking either the left arrow key or the right arrow key to move the character on screen (a roman dude) left or right, respectfully. When the Roman Number falls in the Roman Dude's head, two things can happen. If the Roman Number is the correct trasliation from the arravic number display in the screen. The score will increase by one point, if the Roman NUmber is the wrong tranlation the score will get deducted by one point. Then the Roman Number will disappear and a new one will spawn randomly from above, and in a random distribution. Then the player repeats moving left or right until the score reachest 0 where the player looses, or the score reaches 5 and the player wins. </p>

<p>To make it more fun I would have the game to have more sound effects, like everytime the player choose wrong letter to display a sad sounds, and when he selects the correct one to have a happy song.</p>
<p>Another function that would have been interesting to see is for the Roman numbers to be divided vy V and I, XL, and CM. As the level progreses the game should get harder and harder</p> 



<h4>Prototype goal:</h4>
<p>The most important prototyping for this game is the randomination of the roman numbers, not only do the number have to appeir ina random part of the screen, but also the arabic number has to be random as well. So no palyer can cheat, by tring and error with out learning</p>


<h4>Features:</h4>
<p>Aside from featuring a great depiction of how the Roman life look like in BC era, it has the great randomination that makes the game different evertime, all the time. </p>


<h4>Setting/Premise:</h4>
<p>This game is set in Roman era as you can see the background. The roman dude is wearing a gladiator helmet and a spear. </p>


<h4>Story:</h4>
<p>The gladiator dude needs to get the correct convination for a lock convination and if he gets it wrong then he has start over.</p>


<h4>Target Audience:</h4>
<p>This is mainly intended for kids that are learning Roman Numbers, and want to do it in a fun way</p>


<h4>Play time:</h4>
<p>The Player can go as far as 5 minutes if the correct roman number does not get display sooner.</p>


<h4>Strategies:</h4>
<p>Learn the correct Roman number format is necessary to win this game, also blind luck because there is 1/5 chance of getting the right number</p>


<h4>Prototype Assets:</h4>
<ul>
<li>I borrow alot of code from the classmate jlee139.
<ul>
<li>and from this game
</ul>http://jlee139.github.io/digital-template/
</ul>


<h4>Prototype Closest Other Game:</h4>
<p> there are many game that have this system of catching falling objects, but I only saw this one where you can learn by it.</p>
